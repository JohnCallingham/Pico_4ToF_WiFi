This board was originally designed for the Pico ToF LCC module. However, it could be used as a general purpose I2C board.

The Pi Pico W connects to a LTC4311 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4756) I2C extender.

The second I2C interface is used to avoid any conflict with the first SPI interface which is used for WiFi.
